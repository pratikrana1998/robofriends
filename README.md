A simple React app created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Robofriends is an app that allows you to search from a list of robofriends. It is my first react app that I have created to test out the React library and its components.

This project has been created using React, Redux and Redux-thunk libraries.

The robots have been fetched from JSONplaceholder. You can add your own database for the robots by replacing the apiCall in the actions.
Redux has been used for state management.The thunk middleware has been used for mocking the redux store during testing.

The app has been deployed using github-pages.
You can view the app by clicking the link:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
